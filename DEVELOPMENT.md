# Development

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npx expo start
npx expo start --tunnel  # for WSL users
```

Scan the QR code with the **Expo Go** app (iOS/Android) or press `i`/`a` to open in a simulator.

## Running Tests

```bash
npx jest          # full suite
npx jest <path>   # single file
npx tsc --noEmit  # type check only
```

361 tests cover the game engine, strategy lookup, profile store and stats, and update utility.

## Adding a New Game

1. Create `features/<game>/` with `engine.ts`, `strategy.ts`, `store.ts`, and `components/`
2. Add a route at `app/<game>/index.tsx`
3. Add a tile in `app/(tabs)/index.tsx`
4. Track stats for the game in the profile:
   - Add the game to `GameId` and a new key to `ProfileStats` (`features/profile/types.ts`), and give it a zeroed record in `emptyStats()` (`features/profile/stats.ts`)
   - Add a `GAME_TABS` entry (`features/profile/components/GameStatsTabs.tsx`) so the profile detail screen shows a tab for it
   - Bump the persist `version` in `features/profile/store.ts` and extend `migrateProfileState` (`features/profile/migrate.ts`) so existing profiles get the new key filled with the empty record; cover it in `__tests__/profile/migrate.test.ts`
   - Record settled results from the game store with `useProfileStore.getState().recordHands(...)` (or a game-specific recorder), exactly once per settled hand, including when the player leaves the table mid-hand

## Publishing a Release

Releases come in two forms depending on what changed.

**First-time setup:** `npm install -g eas-cli && eas login`

### JS/Asset changes (most updates) — EAS Update

No new APK needed. Run:

```bash
eas update --channel preview --environment preview --message "describe what changed"
```

Users get the update silently on their next app launch. Takes ~1 minute.

> **`--channel` vs `--environment`:** `--channel preview` controls *which installed apps receive* the update (our APKs are built with `"channel": "preview"` in `eas.json`). `--environment preview` controls *which EAS environment variables get baked into the JS bundle*. Any `EXPO_PUBLIC_*` variables stored on EAS for that environment are inlined into the bundle when you publish. Recent eas-cli versions require `--environment` when running with `--non-interactive`. Interactively, the CLI prompts you to pick one instead. This makes sure the wrong environment's values never get bundled by accident. The project currently has no EAS environment variables (check with `eas env:list --environment preview`), so the flag has no effect yet. It will start to matter once variables such as API URLs or keys are added.

> **Note:** The update is only delivered to APKs whose `runtimeVersion` matches the value in `app.json` at build time. If you bumped `runtimeVersion`, users need a new APK — use the Full APK rebuild flow below.

### Native changes (new permissions, new native packages; e.g. v1.4.0 added expo-image-picker and expo-file-system) — Full APK rebuild

Required when bumping `runtimeVersion` in `app.json`.

1. Bump `"version"` and `"runtimeVersion"` in `app.json`
2. Commit the version bump
3. Build the APK:
   ```bash
   eas build --platform android --profile preview
   ```
4. Download the `.apk` from the link EAS prints when the build finishes (~10–20 min)
5. Create a GitHub release and attach the APK:
   ```bash
   gh release create v<version> ./casino-helper-*.apk \
     --title "Casino Helper v<version>" \
     --notes "Describe what changed"
   ```

Each release gets its own version tag. The Releases page always shows the latest at the top.
